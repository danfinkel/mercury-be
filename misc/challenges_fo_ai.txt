1. Time series -- easy for AI to make logic mistakes trying to write queries that aggregate across time series effectively
2. Q: When a column in data is categorical how can the AI learn the values and label them to common understanding. Ex: M == male and F == female
    eg. -> "Who saw more ads, men or women?" vs "Which gender saw the most ads?"
   User mistake: Assume AI can map categorical variables into human terms


User mistakes w AI:
- AI is more adept w time series than it actually is.
    ---> How to make smarter about typical use cases for time series?
- Assume AI can map categorical variables into human terms
    --> Try adding sample data to prompt?
